FontAwesome Instructions
===

This project is built using FontAwesome 5 Pro v5.6.1, which is a premium plugin. For development purposes without FontAwesome 5 Pro, the free version can be dropped in this folder which will simply replace any Pro-specific icons with question marks. Make sure the file is named `all.min.js`.
